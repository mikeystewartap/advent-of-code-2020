# Advent of code - 2019


## Setup
`npm install`

## Running and testing
Each day part is self contained and can run independently. 
Run the rest for a part with `npm test 1.1` (1.1 being day 1 part one, for example).  The input of each test is the examples given in the parts description.  

To run the part against the real input, `npm start 1.1`.
